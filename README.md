Discord bot written in haskell, for personal use


The bot is written in Haskell with the help of the Calamity library. 
The bot is still in the early phases so some parts are not optimized, and some does not makes sense. 
It also excts a bot-token to be stored in an environmental variable, `$BOT_TOKEN`.
If you are unwilling to change path variables to add the token, just replace the `getEnv "BOT_TOKEN"` to whichever token you want to use.
